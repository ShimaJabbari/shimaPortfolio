    <dt><h2> ● Endurance-S Project: </h2></dt>
   <dd> <p> Endurance-S is a NASA/JPL project which is to create a high caliber simulation of the Endurance 
        rovers using the Unity Real-Time Development Platform to be used by NASA/JPL employees to test the 
        Endurance rover under different conditions and adjusting different components of the rover. Users are 
        allowed to make modifications in different scenarios to best suit the Moon’s terrain.

    <dt><h2> ● Mushroom dataset classification: </h2></dt>
        <dd><p>Python Implementation of various Machine Learning algorithms such as MLP classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), 
        K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees and Random Forests, Neural Networks for UCI mushroom dataset and evaluating 
        their performance via multiple metrics.
    </p></dd>

    <dt><h2>● Social Media App: </h2></dt>
        <dd> <p> An object-oriented JavaScript-based social media platform that empowers users to establish profiles and share images. 
        The platform incorporates a robust rating system for user-generated content. It is built on a foundation of Node.js, 
        leveraging MongoDB as the database solution, and seamlessly integrates Cloudinary services for streamlined image upload 
        and management. The platform ensures enhanced security and user registration efficiency through the implementation of 
        Google Authentication.

        <dt><h2> ● Retail Store: </h2></dt>
        <dd><p>An object-oriented C++, text-based project that gets user data and directs them to the various menus. Both 
            employees and customers can use it. Employees can use it to see their work schedule, their salary, and their employee 
            discounts. Regular and VIP customers can use it for getting their discounts, calculating total price with discount, and 
            calculating delivery costs. It uses vectors and pointers. </dd><p>
